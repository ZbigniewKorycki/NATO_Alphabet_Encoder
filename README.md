<h1>NATO Alphabet Encoder</h1>

This Python script is a simple tool that converts a word or phrase into its equivalent NATO phonetic alphabet representation. The NATO phonetic alphabet, also known as the International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, is used to spell out words and messages over the radio or phone in a clear and unambiguous way.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 26.
